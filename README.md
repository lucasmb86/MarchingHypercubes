# Marching-Hypercube
Implementation of the algorithms in matlab/octave: Combinatorial Marching Hypercube, Combinatorial Continuation Hypercube, Combinatorial Marching Simplex and Combinatorial Continuation Simplex.

Run no.m to create a manifold approximation of a knot.
Run toro.m to create a manifold approximation of a 4D torus.

The output of the algorithms is the combinatorial skeleton of the approximation.
The output files can be visualized using the software implemented at https://github.com/GSBicalho/TrueNgine
